# 89-3210 Course - Youtube Project

This project is a simplified version of YouTube, allowing users to watch videos as a guest or a registered user, so you can upload videos, write comments and see other user's profiles and their videos.

In this exercise, we were asked to add a server to the application so it consists of two main folders:
1. youtube - this is the **client side**, created using React in the first exercise and modified to work with the server
2. server – as the name implies, this is the **server** folder. Using express, mongoose and more libraries.

Please note:
1. **main** branch is the branch for exercise 1
2. **part_2_main** is the branch for exercise 2
   
## A brief explanation about the workflow:

1.	Analysing the requirements from the exercise’s pdf
2.	Putting the requirements in a jira project
3.	Dividing related tasks to each group member (for example, registration and sign-in is one part and upload videos is another). Each group member with a feature branch of its own
4.	Merging everything and working on the main branch until the submitted version

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**
 get to your desired folder and clone the repository with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guybaruch1/Youtube
cd Youtube
git checkout part_2_main
git pull origin part_2_main
```

### Set up MongoDB to work with our app
In order to show the users, videos and comments we created, you need to follow these steps:

**1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and you are connected to your desired port**

**2. Import relevant collections:** the import instructions are for MongoDB Compass, but you can also use shell if you wish.
Go to Youtube/web/csv_files. There you can find 2 csv files for our collections.
Under "test" database in MongoDB (you can use whatever MongoDB port you want), create two collections:
1. usermodels
2. videomodels

For each one of them:
- Click "ADD DATA +"
- Choose "Import JSON or CSV file"
- Choose the right CSV file, provided in the CSV folder

Most importantly, for videomodel you have to make sure uploaderId is set to be **ObjectId** as in the picture:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dde7419d-66be-4064-9d97-defbcf43c404)

**Drop `id_1` Index:** in case an `id_1` index appears in the `videomodels` collection in the `test` database (or the database you use), user will be limited to upload just a single video.
The solution is dropping it using the following command in your MongoDB Compass under Indexes or via MongoDB shell:
```bash
use test
db.videomodels.dropIndex("id_1")
```
### Open your code editor/IDE:

Assuming you opened the project in your code editor/IDE under Youtube folder, follow the next steps:

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd web/youtube
npm install react
npm run build
```
**Create a configuration file:** under server/config, create a file called ".env.local" which consist the following lines:
```
CONNECTION_STRING = "mongodb://localhost:YOUR_PORT_OF_CHOICE"
PORT = 8080
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
Make sure port is "8080" and SECRET_KEY is "your_secret_key" as defined above. However, you can choose your own MongoDB port if you know how to use it (the same port you used to import our data earlier).

**Run the project - running the server:** Assuming you are under Youtube/web in your terminal, start the development server using
```bash
cd ../server
npm install custom-env express body-parser cors mongoose path
npm start
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
Please note that the JWT you get when log-in to your account expires within 1 hour. After that time, you will not be able to upload, edit or delete anything. You can sign-out and then sign-in again and you will be able to perform these actions.

## Some screenshots from the application

**Homescreen:** you should see in your homescreen 20 videos (10 of them are the most viewed videos and 10 of them are random) in random order:

**Get to your profile:** when you sign in, you can access to your user profile clicking on your image on the right:

**User profile:** this is how your profile looks when you uploaded videos:

**Edit your video** when logged-in as the uploader, you can see two buttons to edit/delete your video

Enjoy the watch!
=======
Navigate to the cloned repository directory, then open the Youtube/android folder.

**3. Build the project:**

Once the project is opened in Android Studio, it will begin to sync and build the project. If it doesn't start automatically, you can sync the project with Gradle files by clicking on the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button (usually found in the toolbar).

**4. Install dependencies:**

Android Studio will handle most dependencies automatically. Ensure you have an internet connection for Gradle to download any necessary dependencies.

**5. Run the project:**
Connect an Android device to your computer or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) through Android Studio.

Click on the "Run" button (the green play button in the toolbar) or select Run > Run 'app' from the top menu.

Choose your connected device or AVD from the list and click OK.

The application should now be running on your selected Android device or emulator.
